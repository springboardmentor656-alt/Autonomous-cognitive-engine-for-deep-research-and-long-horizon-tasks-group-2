Based on the provided rubric, I will evaluate the report as follows:

1. **Accuracy: 4**
The report provides factually correct information about the impact of COVID-19 on global supply chains. The references cited are reputable sources, and the information presented is consistent with the current understanding of the topic.

2. **Completeness: 4**
The report addresses the main aspects of the research topic, including the impact of COVID-19 on global supply chains, affected industries, and proposed managerial insights. However, the report could be more comprehensive, as it does not provide an exhaustive analysis of all possible aspects of the topic. Additionally, the TODO list is not explicitly mentioned in the report, but based on the content, it seems that the report covers the main points that would be expected in such a study.

3. **Structure: 5**
The report is professionally formatted in Markdown, with clear headings, sections, and bullet points. The structure is logical and easy to follow, making it simple for the reader to navigate and understand the content.

**Final Score: 4.3/5**

Justification:
The report provides a well-structured and accurate overview of the impact of COVID-19 on global supply chains. The use of reputable references and the clear presentation of information demonstrate a good understanding of the topic. However, the report could benefit from a more comprehensive analysis of the topic, including a deeper dive into specific industries and a more detailed examination of the proposed managerial insights. Overall, the report is well-written and effectively communicates the main points, but it falls short of being a truly exhaustive and definitive study on the subject.
